This folder contains configurations used by Github CI/CD to automatically
generate artifacts.

They should follow the standard configurations but may differ to ensure the
automation remains stable (i.e standardising file names/paths).

Any thconfig placed in here will be run and any PDF, SVG, 3D, LOX that is
produced in the \_outputs directory (not in any subdirectory) will be uploaded
to the release on Github.
